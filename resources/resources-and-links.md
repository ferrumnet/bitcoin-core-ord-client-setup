## bitcoin.conf file update <a href="#communities" id="communities"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
If you did not follow this Ninja Mac Guide from the beginning, then you need to first check and make sure your directories and tooling are correctly setup. You need to check that your files are in your [SSD/Bitcoin folder as described here](faqs.md#update-bitcoin-directory-if-needed) (3 mins effort), and you need to make sure your SSD is named "Bitcoin", if not, then follow these steps to [Update your SSD name to Bitcoin](faqs.md#update-ssd-name-to-standardized-name-so-all-commands-work) (2 mins effort) so all standardized commands will work. Additionally, make sure you have installed all tools from [here](../fundamentals/install-required-tools-homebrew-oh-my-zsh-visual-studio-rust-transmission.md) (10 mins effort). Then you can proceed to the instructions below.

12. (Optional) You can check that this the folder and file mentioned in the previous step have been created properly by opening your SSD and checking to see that there is now a "Bitcoin" folder and within that folder is a "bitcoin.conf" file. \
