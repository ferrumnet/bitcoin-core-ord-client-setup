# ðŸ’¡ Why do you need to run a node?

> **Introduction: Why set up a Bitcoin node?**&#x20;
>
> Every website that supports Runes will go live at the same time with the Runes protocol on the halving block (840,000) expected around April 20th. Watch [https://mempool.space/](https://mempool.space/) to see the current block. Blocks are on average every 10 minutes or 144 every 24 hours. What this means is that these websites will be untested and may run into issues that could cost you several hours on launch day. These several hours could put you out of the game and make you miss your big opportunity. All of these websites will be using Casey Rodarmor's Runes software under the hood, which is the only software guaranteed to work on launch. You can also use this same software on your computer, so this is what we recommend to maximize the chances of your success.
